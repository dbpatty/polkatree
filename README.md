 <h1 align="right">Welcome to POLKATREE project by ANAMIX</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/dbpatty/polkatree/blob/master/polkatree/img/polkatree1.png" height="150px" /> 
<p align="left">This site was created to help people, mainly validators, who want to quickly follow the status and the evolution of the Polkadot chains and parachains.
In the future we will be adding a Telegram bot to provide information on updates
 as they become available. We will also be adding a CoinGeko API connection. If you are interested in adding a project or modifying an existing project, feel free to create a pull request or leave feedback here.
